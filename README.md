# üß© CodeChef Solutions

This repository contains some of the **CodeChef problems** I‚Äôve solved during my competitive programming journey.  
All files are direct solutions ‚Äî no specific folder structure, just pure problem-solving code.

## üöÄ About

I created this repository to:
- Keep a record of my **CodeChef solutions** in one place.
- Track my **progress** over time.
- Help others understand **approaches to different problems**.

The solutions are written mainly in **C++**, **Python**, and **Java** (depending on the problem).

Each file name usually matches the **problem code** from CodeChef (for example: `FLOW001.cpp`, `START98D.cpp`, etc.).
